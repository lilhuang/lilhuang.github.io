## Physical Activities

I lift regularly. I used to powerlift (best squat 210lbs x2, best bench 135lbs x1, best conventional-stance deadlift 225lbs x2 circa summer of 2019), but then I found out I had degenerated discs in my back. So my aging ass has had to stop screwing around and focus more on longevity. I am Weak now, but at least I can hope to live past 50.

I also play pickup ultimate regularly, weather permitting. In Ann Arbor, we have a pretty robust pickup scene and we have played in rain, snow, dark, heat, and humidity. Sometimes we even play even it's actually nice outside. I have also played in college intramural and Ann Arbor leagues, which is daunting but offers a lot of opportunity for growth. I think ultimate is fun and forces me to actually do cardio, which my body both thanks and hates me for.

I used to do synchronized swimming. I miss the teamwork and the sparkly suits. I do not miss the [gelatin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tljtD49-b2o).
