# Holmes and Moriarty | January 2025

A drama sequence (loosely) adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's *The Final Problem*, depicting Sherlock Holmes's first meeting with his famed nemesis, Professor Moriarty.

This was a personal project from my StoryboardArt Story Mentorship, which ran from January 2024 -- January 2025.
