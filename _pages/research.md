I work on machine learning-guided in-betweening for hand-drawn animation. Since traditional 2D animation is time-consuming and expensive to produce, there is great interest in reducing animators’ workload, and one way to do this would be to reduce the work involved in drawing in-betweens. I am interested in using deep learning, computer vision-based methods to be able to understand the content of simple sequential pencil-on-paper drawings, and generate high-fidelity in-betweens where necessary. Currently we are exploring flow-based video interpolation methods, used in conjunction with a foreground segmentation module and an adversarial module to better adapt to a hand-drawn domain (“pencil tests”).

Other projects I have worked on include:
    - [Few-shot learning](../docs/WiMLAbstract.pdf), presented as a poster at the Women in Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS in 2019
    - [Sensitivity of Carbon and Oxygen Yields to the Triple-Alpha Resonance in Massive Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09168)
    - [Determination of the _WW_ polarization fractions in _pp_-->_WWjj_ using a deep machine learning technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01691)
