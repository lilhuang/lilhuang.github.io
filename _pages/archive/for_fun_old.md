## Art

I really like art, drawing, painting, and animation. I sometimes [post it online](https://www.instagram.com/itsalilstrange/) for other people to see. I currently do a lot of cafe sketching to improve my drawing, and am trying to improve my storytelling abilities.

When I need inspiration, I like to watch short films from [Gobelins](https://www.youtube.com/user/gobelins), an animation school in France. I also like to look at the work of [Mike Dutton](https://www.instagram.com/duttonart/), [Mabel Ye](https://www.instagram.com/mobblele/), [Tuna Bora](https://www.instagram.com/tunamunaluna/), [Seong Ryul](https://www.instagram.com/sseongryul/), and [Sas Milledge](https://www.instagram.com/sasmilledge/), among many others. If you want to learn more about hand-drawn animation, I encourage you to look to the work of [Milt Kahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milt_Kahl), [Glen Keane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Keane), [Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki), and [James Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baxter_(animator)).

## Physical Activities

I powerlift regularly. My best squat is 210x2, best bench is 135x1, and best deadlift is 225x2. I have recently switched from conventional to sumo deadlift, and hope that this will suit my quad-dominant lifting style better.

I play pickup ultimate semi-regularly, weather permitting. In college, I won a couple of intramural tournaments, but mostly due to my teammates, not me. It is fun and forces me to actually do cardio.

I used to do synchronized swimming. I miss the teamwork and the sparkly suits. I do not miss the [gelatin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tljtD49-b2o).

## Music

I am currently a big fan of [Vulfpeck](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWuB1D_E3mcyYThA9iKggQ) [et.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCImcy57uN-d25Uy7pRP8N3A) [al](https://www.youtube.com/c/CoryWongMusic), [Taylor Swift](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqECaJ8Gagnn7YCbPEzWH6g), and [BTS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_Cqw69_m_yz4JcOfmZb2IDWwIuej1xfN). Growing up, I listened to a lot of [Ella Fitzgerald](https://www.youtube.com/c/ellafitzgerald) and [Gershwin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg-kugyJTfg).

I also play piano sometimes. My favorite piece I've ever played is [Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9QLiefnoDE), though only the first movement. I also found [Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25BCBH9tNaw) to be delightful.
