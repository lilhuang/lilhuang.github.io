		Hi! I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland. I am currently an RA working on computer vision research with Professor Abhinav Shrivastava. You can read more about my research <a href="research.html">here</a>. Before graduate school, I received my B.S. from the University of Michigan in honors physics and computer science.

	<p>
		Fun fact: I grew up in Ann Arbor amidst the fervor of the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry, and was still too apathetic about sports to make it to a single Michigan football game until my senior year of college. I also then left said game by the beginning of the fourth quarter. I have since remained pretty disinterested in football, but now that I've moved away, my desire for Michigan's athletic success has increased tenfold due to nostalgia for my hometown.
