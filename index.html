				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					Hi<a href="outtakephotos.html" class="outtake_photos">!</a> I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland. I am currently an RA working on computer vision research with Professor Abhinav Shrivastava. You can read more about my research <a href="research.html">here</a>. Before graduate school, I received my B.S. from the University of Michigan in honors physics and computer science.

				<p class="funfact">
					Fun fact: I grew up in Ann Arbor amidst the fervor of the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry, and was still too apathetic about sports to make it to a single Michigan football game until my senior year of college. I also then left said game before the beginning of fourth quarter. I have since remained pretty disinterested in football, but now that I've moved away, my desire for Michigan's athletic success has increased tenfold due to nostalgia for my hometown. I used to look down on Ann Arbor townies, but I guess I am one now that I find myself vehemently clinging to my tendency to pronounce "eggs" as "aiggs" and say "pop" instead of "soda." This will have to suffice as a personality for now as I update and reboot my operating system to fix behavioral bugs. I am content with this, as I'm sure this will not be much different than when I had an actual soul&mdash;at least I am sticking to monotonic improvement. This <i>is</i> the Michigan Difference.
