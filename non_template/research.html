	<p>I am currently doing research on low-shot learning in image classification and recognition with Professor <a href="http://abhinavsh.info/">Abhinav Shrivastava</a> at the University of Maryland's computer science department. <a href="/docs/WiMLAbstract.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an extended abstract detailing some of the work I have done in this area. I am generally interested in learning recognition models with limited supervision and guiding such processes by leveraging previously-learned knowledge, such as using context clues or by doing component analysis.</p>
